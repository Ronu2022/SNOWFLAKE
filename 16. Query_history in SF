/* Query History In SF*/


-- allows 14 days of viewing query histor.
-- various options to filter : by user,warehouse,etc. 
-- allows download of results for 24 hrs.
-- you can view any query history, but not the result. 


select * from "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"."TPCDS_SF100TCL"."CALL_CENTER";


-- let's first suspend the virtual warehouse

alter warehouse compute_wh resume;  -- resumed
alter warehouse compute_wh suspend;  -- suspended


select count(*) from "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"."TPCDS_SF100TCL"."CALL_CENTER"; -- look the warehouse is supeneded still
-- snowflake gives result withjout using the warehouse.

-- Recall the architecture of SF: 
  -- Service Layer : in this cloud service layer, metadata is stored, meant for optimisation of queries
  -- Compute Layer
  -- Storage Layer 

-- so, the metadata of the table: rowcount, size, variable, types etc are stored in the cloud service layer
-- thus, snowflake while giving you these details doesnt require the usage of warehouses 


-- let's try select statemnet: 

select * from "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"."TPCDS_SF100TCL"."CALL_CENTER"; -- note the warehouse is now utilised turns green 
-- because the cloud service layer only keeps the Metadata in it, doesnt stores the actual data. 
-- to get actual data the warehouse is required.  -- NOTE : this took 109 ms to get the results

select * from "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"."TPCDS_SF100TCL"."CALL_CENTER"; -- took 79 ms suggests, this time it didnt go to the origibal location to retireve rather got data from the content already retrieved i.e results. 


-- let's now use a where condition to check 

select * from "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"."TPCDS_SF100TCL"."CALL_CENTER"
where CC_CALL_CENTER_SK <= 5; -- took 785ms

select * from "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"."TPCDS_SF100TCL"."CALL_CENTER"
where CC_CALL_CENTER_SK <= 5;  -- took 67ms : fetched from the result query, this way SF optimizes the costs.

/*SQL QUERY HISTORY COMMANDS*/ 

-- last 100 queries in the current_session:

-- query history by warehouse
