-- The company can distribute goods via various channels such as wholesale, retail, eCommerce, and TV shopping.
-- The following statement inserts sales channels into the sales_channel table:

INSERT INTO sales_channel (channel_id, channel)
VALUES
	(1, 'Wholesale'),
	(2, 'Retail'),
	(3, 'eCommerce'),
	(4, 'TV Shopping');

select * from sales_organization;
select * from sales_channel;



-- To find the all possible sales channels that a sales organization can have, you use the CROSS JOIN to join the sales_organization table with the sales_channel table as follows:

SELECT sales_org,channel
FROM sales_organization
CROSS JOIN sales_channel; 

-- The result set includes all possible rows in the sales_organization and sales_channel tables.

-- The following query is equivalent to the statement that uses the CROSS JOIN clause above:

SELECT sales_org,channel
FROM sales_organization,sales_channel;


-- In some database systems such as PostgreSQL and Oracle, you can use the INNER JOIN clause with the condition that always evaluates to true to perform a cross join such as:

SELECT sales_org,channel
FROM sales_organization
INNER JOIN sales_channel ON 1 = 1;
